# About the lab

This folder hosts the incubator components that are not yet ready to move to the
main `components` folder. The components in this folder are not guaranteed to be
stable or to have a stable API. They are subject to change without notice.

As we use and test these components we will learn more about the shortcomings of
the components: missing features, API design, HI feedback, etc.

For a component to e ready to move to the main `components` folder, the
following are considered:

- It needs to be used. A lab component with low usage eitehr means that it isn't
  fully working yet, or that there is low demand for it.
- It needs to match the code quality of the main `components`. It doesn't have
  to be perfect, but it should be reliable enough that we can depend on it.
  - Each component needs type definitions.
  - Each type definition should be properly documented with JSDoc comments.
  - Requires good test coverage.
  - Requires a Storybook story for each component.
- It needs to be stable. The API should be stable enough that we can depend on
  it not changing in a breaking way.
- It needs HI feedback. The component should be reviewed by the HI team to make
  sure it meets the design requirements.

## Usage

To use a lab component, import it from the `@shared-components`. These components
are prefixed with `UNSTABLE_` to indicate that they are not yet stable.

```tsx
import { UNSTABLE_LabComponent } from "@shared-components";
```

## Development

To develop a lab component, create a new component in the `src/labs` directory.
This component and props interface should be prefixed with `UNSTABLE_` to
indicate that it is not yet stable.

```tsx
export interface UNSTABLE_LabComponentProps {
  // Props go here
}

export const UNSTABLE_LabComponent = ({}: UNSTABLE_LabComponentProps) => {
  return <div>Lab Component</div>;
};
```

To add a story for the lab component, create a new story file in the `src/labs`
directory. This file should be named `LabComponent.stories.tsx`. The story title
should be prefixed with the `Labs` path followed by the component name.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { UNSTABLE_LabComponent } from "./LabComponent";

export default {
  title: "Labs/UNSTABLE_LabComponent",
  component: UNSTABLE_LabComponent,
};

export const Default = () => <UNSTABLE_LabComponent />;
```
